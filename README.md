# babynames
popular names in at least one year between 1900 and 2012
The baby names data set consists of over 200 files (data sets are attached to this message). 
Each file contains a list of 100 names, along with the number of times each name was used.
Entries in the files are ordered from most frequently used to least frequently used.
There are two files for each year: one containing names used for girls and the other containing names used for boys.
The data set includes data for every year from 1900 to 2012.
I wrote a program that reads every file in the data set and identifies all of the names that were most popular in at least one year.
My program outputs two lists: one containing the most popular names for boys and the other containing the most popular names for girls. 
Neither of my lists should includes any repeated values.
